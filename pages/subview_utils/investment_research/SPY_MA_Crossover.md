# SPY 50/200-Day Moving Average Crossover Strategy

## Objective

Evaluate a simple trend-following strategy using the 50-day and 200-day moving averages on SPY (S&P 500 ETF).

## Strategy Description

- **Buy Signal**: When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA (Golden Cross)
- **Sell Signal**: When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA (Death Cross)

This method assumes market momentum and trend persistence following a crossover event.
