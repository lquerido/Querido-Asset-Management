# Investment Philosophy

At **Querido Asset Management**, we believe markets are not always rational. While they often reflect available information (semi-strong form efficiency), inefficiencies persist—offering opportunities for skilled investors to outperform.

We favor **systematic investment strategies** that leverage data, rules-based logic, and quantitative models to make decisions. This approach enhances consistency, reduces emotional bias, and allows scalable execution—advantages discretionary methods struggle to match.

**Risk management is at the core** of our philosophy. Capital preservation is paramount, and we prioritize strategies that seek asymmetric outcomes: minimizing downside while capturing upside.

We are guided by a continual process of research, testing, and refinement—believing that adaptability and intellectual humility are essential for long-term success in ever-evolving markets.
